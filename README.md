Our EDS project on amphibians

Julien Practical 4:
First, import fun_eds to weather_data_import.py. For each of our weather data files, to print the data for one variable, use the function fun_eds.import_get_var() with three inputs, the file path, which is the same for each file, the file name, and the desired variable, for example, 'metANN'. This will output the desired data. Optionally, store this value in a variable and then print the variable, or just print in the same line. Finally, call python weather_data_import.py in the terminal to run the code.

I did not use generative AI on this assignment.
